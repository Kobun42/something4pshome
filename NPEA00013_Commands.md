## home
Logs one into Playstation Home.
## map (map_name)
Attempts to grab an SDC file from the homeps3-content.online.scee.com server. You need the LOCALSCENELIST.XML file in the Environment folder for development versions of the application.
## loadmodel (filename.dat)
Loads a model into the current scene, whether it be the login screen, or anything like Home Square, it will put it in. This command uses DAT files.
## cd (directory)
If you know how to use MS-DOS or Command Prompt, then you should know what this does, but for people who don't, this changes the directory you are currently in.
## cp (testing, so the arguments are unknown, I believe it might be like the copy command in CMD)
Copies files to a directory.
