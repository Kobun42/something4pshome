## home
Logs one into Playstation Home.
## map (map_name)
Attempts to grab an SDC file from the homeps3-content.online.scee.com server. You need the LOCALSCENELIST.XML file in the Environment folder for development versions of the application.
## loadmodel (filename.dat)
Loads a model into the current scene, whether it be the login screen, or anything like Home Square, it will put it in. This command uses DAT files.
## cd (directory)
If you know how to use MS-DOS or Command Prompt, then you should know what this does, but for people who don't, this changes the directory you are currently in.
## cp (testing, so the arguments are unknown, I believe it might be like the copy command in CMD)
Copies files to a directory.
## contentServerOverride (server url or ip)
This command changes the server from which content is fetched from, so if you used the map command after this, it'll instead try to fetch it from the server you selected.
